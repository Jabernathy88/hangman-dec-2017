# ZOMBIE HANGMAN

WDI Project 1
By Jeremy Abernathy
Dec. 14, 2017

### Short Description

Hangman is a classic children's game with simple rules that, for a modern audience, could be scaled up and styled in unique ways. The TV game show "Wheel of Fortune" is an example of how Hangman's concept of "fill the hidden blanks" can apply to different formats for different audiences.
